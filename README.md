# My Cloud Resume Challenge

Welcome to my Cloud Resume Challenge project! 
This project represents my endeavor to tackle the Cloud Resume Challenge within the AWS environment.This is an exciting journey where I showcase my skills in web development, cloud computing, and infrastructure as code. But what exactly is the Cloud Resume Challenge? It is a comprehensive resume project comprising multiple steps, strategically designed to develop and showcase essential skills crucial for a career in Cloud computing. The initiative was introduced by Forrest Brazeal. Let's dive into the details:

In this project, I've built a personalized resume website and hosted it using cloud services. Here's what you'll find:

1.**Resume Website:**
   - I've crafted a unique and interactive resume website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to reflect my skills, experience, and personality.

2. **Cloud Hosting:**
   - The website is hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) to leverage the power and scalability of cloud infrastructure.

3. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
   - I've embraced the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CloudFormation. The entire cloud infrastructure is defined in code for easy management.

4. **CI/CD Automation:**
   - Experience seamless updates with a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that automates the deployment process on every change.
